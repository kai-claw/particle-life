# 🌊 Particle Life

An emergent behavior / artificial life simulator that demonstrates how simple rules can create complex, mesmerizing patterns.

## ✨ Features

- **6 Particle Types** - Each with unique colors and interaction rules
- **Emergent Behaviors** - Watch particles self-organize into cells, hunters, ecosystems, and more
- **Interactive Rule Matrix** - Edit attraction/repulsion values between particle types
- **Presets** - Discover fascinating configurations like "Ecosystems", "Cells", "Hunters"
- **Real-time Controls** - Adjust speed, friction, interaction radius, and particle count
- **Trail Effects** - Beautiful particle trails that fade over time
- **High Performance** - Spatial hashing enables smooth simulation of 3000+ particles

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Start/Pause** - Control the simulation
2. **Try Presets** - Explore pre-configured rule sets that create different behaviors
3. **Randomize Rules** - Discover new emergent patterns
4. **Adjust Parameters** - Fine-tune speed, friction, and forces
5. **Edit Rules** - Click on matrix values to manually adjust attraction/repulsion

## 🔬 The Science

Particle Life demonstrates **emergent complexity** - how simple local interactions between particles can give rise to complex global behaviors:

- Particles are attracted or repulsed by other particle types
- Each particle type has a unique "DNA" - its attraction/repulsion values to all other types
- These simple rules create lifelike behaviors: predation, symbiosis, competition

## 🚀 Built With

- React + TypeScript
- HTML5 Canvas for high-performance rendering
- Spatial hashing for efficient neighbor detection
- Vite for fast development and building
